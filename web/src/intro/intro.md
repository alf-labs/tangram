# Tangram Puzzle

A [Tangram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram) is a "dissection puzzle"
composed of a number of flat wooden pieces which are assembled to form a specific
shape.

project deals with a variant called **12 pieces hexagon tangram jigsaw**.  
Whereas a traditional tangram seems to have only 7 pieces,  
as the name indicates, this puzzle uses 12 pieces which fit in an enclosing hexagon.  
There are actually 8 shapes of pieces, and 5 different colors.

Solving the puzzle is rather simple -- just place the pieces till they fit.

The complexity amount is fairly low. As a simple brain teaser, or mental fidget,
most solutions can often be found in a few seconds, although some initial pieces
placements are dead ends which are not necessarily obvious at first and can result
in a several minutes of attempts at solving the puzzle via trial and error.
In other words, it's a lot of fun.
